I want Michael Jackson land, ohh
Aww, I'ma cash out (On what?)
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me (Moon)
I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo (What?)
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo (Ha)
I'm back at it (What?), Juug man voice (Yung Ralph, hahaha, hehe), Bankhead
Hear my song way from Y-T-C-R-O-B-S-M-M, now we YSL venom, sis
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
